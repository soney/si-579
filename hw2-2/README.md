## Exercise 1: Fibonacci Sequence

A Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...
Wrote a function that will print out the n-th element in the Fibonacci sequence.

```
// Exercise 1
// Step 1. Define the Function


// Step 2. Evaluate the Output
console.log(`Q1 - the 5th number is `) // expect output: Q1 - the 5th number is 3
console.log(`Q1 - the 7th number is `) // expect output: Q1 - the 7th number is 8
```

## Exercise 2: Farm Market

Suppose the farm has the following types of fruits. Find a proper way to represent the data in JavaScript. Sort the fruit names by the number and total price (from the greatest to the least), separate by `, `.

| Fruit Name | Number | Unit Price |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Apple      | 12     | 3          |
| Orange     | 16     | 5          |
| Grape      | 5      | 8          |

```
// Exercise 2
// Step 1. Represent the Data


// Step 2. Sort the Name
console.log(`Q2 - sort by number:`) // expect output: Q2 - sort by number: Orange, Apple, Grape
console.log(`Q2 - sort by total price:`) // expect output: Q2 - sort by total price: Orange, Grape, Apple
