<h1>Excercise 1</h1>
<p>Change the color of the div on mouse click.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the square once should change it to the color you like using only Javascript. </li>
    <li>Change the color name on the div section to the current background color.</li>
    <li>Click on the div a second time should change the background color back to the original color.</li>
</ol>

<div id = "color-block">
    <p id="center-text">The color is: <span id = "color-name">#F08080</span> </p>
</div>

<h1>Excercise 2</h1>
<p>Convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius when the submit button is clicked. The excercise should be able to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Read the input of Fahrenheit from the user. </li>
    <li>Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius using Javascript. </li>
    <li>When button is clicked, the result should show up behind the word Celsius:</li>
</ol>
    <br>
    *To convert temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius, subtract 32 and multiply by 5/9.<br>



<input type="number" id="f-input" name="f-input" placeholder="Fahrenheit degree &#8457">
<input type="submit" value="convert" id = "convertbtn">

<p>Celsius: <span id = "c-output"></span> &#8451</p>


<h1>Excercise 3</h1>
<p>Build a simple log in page using HTML, CSS and JS. Since we are not connecting
    to database or backend for now, all we need to do is to make sure that when the submit button of the log in page is pressed,
    the inputs from the user is received and showed on the page.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Two required fields of the log in page - User/Email and Password (use the input tag from HTML to achieve this)</li>
    <li>When the submit button is pressed, user input will show on the page
        (In real application this information is usually send to the backend for verification,
        but in this exercise we just want you to be familiar with HTML forms, receiving userâ€™s input and display text with JavaScript)
    </li>
</ol>
