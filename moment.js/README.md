# Exercise: Date Keeper

This exercise helps you practice the knowledge of integrating libraries by implementing a date keeper application.
You will need to use the moment.js library to finish the task.

The application allows users to enter an event with a time that the event occured.
The page would show the list of the event with unified timeformat, and the past days that the event occured.

The exercise can be unfolded into these steps:
- Step 1. Add the input widgets, implement the add button so that it would append the input directly to the list

- Step 2. Include the moment.js library, display the time in unified format

- Step 3. Use the moment.js library to calculate the past days, display it in the list

- Step 4 (advanced). What if the date is something in the future?

Other advanced ideas:

- add a time picker that allows users to simulate any date as the current date
- display the exact date, month, and year for the 100 days anniversary for every events
